# Formal Languages and Automata Theory Project

Implementation of Deterministic Finite Automata (DFA), Nondeterministic Finite Automata (NFA), and Nondeterministic Finite Automata with Lambda Transitions (Î»-NFA) in Python. Additionally, a program is included to generate and display all words of length n derived from a given regular grammar.
